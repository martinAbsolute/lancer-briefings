# FMJ-MC Mission Debrief // 3.20.5014u

To stop **ROOK** forces in the region from shooting down a **SeccCom** GOLIATH-class ship when it arrives, **Alpha-Zero-Zero-One** has to take control of DDSCA, a Distributed Deep-space Comms Array. It communicates directly with the sattelites in Ganymede's orbit, allowing for secure communication with **SeccCom**.

The **ROOK** forces are already on the move, and they're not going to let **Alpha-Zero-Zero-One** take control of the Comms Array without a fight.

# FMJ-MC Forward Operating Deployment // 3.20.5014u

DDSCA is an array of three communication dishes, currently deployed in a destroyed colony worker town called **Haven**. The town is a ghost town, with only a few buildings still standing. The Comms Array consists of three dishes, each one about 5 meters in diameter.

While it's possible to attempts to hack it, due to an approaching sandstorm, you'll have to physically take control of the Comms Array to ensure that the message to **SeccCom** gets through.
