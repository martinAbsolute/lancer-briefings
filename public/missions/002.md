# Mission // #002
## Hyper Accelerated Dragon
# Goals
- Locate the deployed DDSCA: Distributed Deep-space Comms Array.
- Hold the Comms Array until a message to **SeccCom** can be transmitted.

# Stakes
- Allowing **ROOK** forces to control the Comms Array will allow them to fry the satellite circuits, rendering them useless to contact **SeccCom** in time for arrival.

# Reserves
- None. You scrapped the Bombard for repairs, remember?
