Born on the desert planet of Aridium, Asher grew up amidst the harsh conditions of a frontier colony. His parents were renowned prospectors, scouring the barren landscapes in search of valuable minerals and resources. From a young age, Asher learned the importance of self-reliance and resilience, skills that would serve him well in the years to come.

Tragedy struck when Asher was just 12 years old. During a routine mining expedition, his parents' hovercraft malfunctioned, plummeting into a deep ravine. Asher was left orphaned, with nothing but the vast expanse of the desert to call home. Determined to honor his parents' memory, he vowed to carry on their legacy and become the greatest prospector Aridium had ever seen.

For years, Asher roamed the desert wastelands, eking out a meager existence by salvaging scraps and selling them to passing traders. Despite the hardships he faced, he never lost sight of his dream. It was during one of his scavenging missions that he stumbled upon the wreckage of an old mech, buried beneath the sands.

Intrigued by the prospect of salvaging the mech for parts, Asher began to tinker with the ancient technology. To his surprise, he discovered a dormant NHP nestled deep within the mech's circuitry. Fueled by curiosity and a thirst for knowledge, Asher embarked on a journey to unlock the secrets of the NHP, all while navigating the dangers of the unforgiving desert.

Now 22 years old, Asher finds himself at a crossroads. With rumors of conflict brewing on the horizon, he knows that the time has come to choose his path. Will he continue to eke out a living in the desolate wastelands, or will he dare to pursue his dreams of becoming a mech pilot and carving out a new destiny for himself? Only time will tell.
