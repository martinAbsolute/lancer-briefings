Born into a family of renowned engineers and scientists on the technologically advanced planet of NeoTerra, Elara was expected to follow in her family's footsteps. However, tragedy struck when she was just 15 years old. During a routine experiment involving the manipulation of quantum energies, a catastrophic accident occurred, claiming the lives of both her parents. Elara was left orphaned and scarred, both physically and emotionally, by the incident.

Struggling to come to terms with her loss and grappling with survivor's guilt, Elara found herself navigating the harsh realities of the streets. She took odd jobs to survive, relying on her quick wit and resourcefulness to stay afloat. It was during this time that she developed a deep-seated apprehension towards advanced technologies, haunted by the memories of her parents' experiments gone awry.

Eventually, Elara found solace and purpose in the underground world of mech racing. Drawn to the adrenaline rush and the thrill of competition, she threw herself into the sport wholeheartedly. With each race, she pushed herself to the limit, determined to prove that she was more than the sum of her tragic past.

Now 25 years old, Elara harbors a secret passion for tinkering with old-fashioned mechanical contraptions, a skill she picked up during her time on the streets. Despite her reservations about advanced technology, she finds herself drawn to understanding the inner workings of NHPs, albeit cautiously. Deep down, she knows that her fear of repeating her parents' mistakes may hold her back, but she refuses to let it define her.
