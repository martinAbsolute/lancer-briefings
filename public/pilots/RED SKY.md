### Bio

Frederick Valasky (Red Sky) was a commander of a squad in a mercenaries company named Raven Beak. "Cold-blooded" as some of the team called him, give him his call sign - "Red Sky", because when he comes into close combat with enemies skyes goes red with blood (and someone thinks it is just a shortened version of his name... pathetic believers who don't see him in action). Squad size - 3-6 lancers. "Red Sky" - commander, "Jimbo" - master of explosions, "Hawk" - sniper support - the main team formed of 3 people. When needed, "Silly Bee" - master of drones, "Arm G Don" - artillerist, and "Vics" - stealthy killer - come at help of the main squad. 

The squad has more than 20 successful missions completed, about 3 failed (show me the man who never loses), and 1 that was fatal for a squad. It was a mission to collect data from a research facility on asteroid KX401S, and the information given was fake. No, no one died from a squad, but we were waiting for a little defense with turrets and mechs (as was said in brief), but there were only mining mechs, that couldn't even oppose a military one, and the facility... there is no research, it was a colony, where people tried to survive. "Red" helped them to improve their defense with his old friends from the army, who want a stable life, with low conflicts in a good society. So Red was thrown out from a company for diversing the mission. Squad members, well... some go out for their purposes, some stay. As for me, I'm a lone wolf now, and this information is a recommendation for my good commander.

P.S. It was an honor to serve in one squad with Red, just tell him, but don't tell from whom.

Best regards, Jimbo
